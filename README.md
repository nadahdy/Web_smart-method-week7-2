This project studies the differences between the classic navigation stack and navigation with reinforcement learning (RL).
	•	Classic navigation relies on mapping, localization, and rule-based planners (e.g., A*, DWA). It is robust, predictable, and widely used in structured environments but requires precise models and extensive tuning.
	•	Reinforcement learning navigation enables robots to learn navigation policies through trial-and-error, guided by rewards. It adapts better to dynamic and unstructured environments but demands large training data, high computation, and may lack reliability in real-world deployment.

Overall, classic methods provide stability, while RL offers adaptability. A hybrid approach combining both could leverage the strengths of each.
